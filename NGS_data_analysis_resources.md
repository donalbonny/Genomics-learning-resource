[FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), written by Simon Andrews of Babraham Bioinformatics, is a very popular tool used to provide an overview of basic quality control metrics for raw next generation sequencing data. There are a number different analyses (called modules) that may be performed on a sequence data set. By default the RTSF Genomics Core does not perform all these because some are redundant, do not provide significant meaningful information, or are more informative to the core facility than the end user.

In addition to the information provided here, documentation is available online at the FastQC website.
