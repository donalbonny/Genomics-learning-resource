# Predictive Modeling with Supervised Machine Learning

### Examples: 

predicting gene expression from epigenetic modifications (Dong et al. (2012))
predicting gene locations (Mathe et al. (2002))
predicting enhancer or other regulatory regions (Fernandez and Miranda-Saavedra (2012))
predicting drug response based on genomics (Wang, McLeod, and Weinshilboum (2011))
predicting healthy/disease status or disease subtypes based on genomics (Kourou et al. (2015))
predicting the effect of SNPs on gene regulation (Zhou and Troyanskaya (2015))
calling SNPs (Poplin et al. (2018))
