[FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), written by Simon Andrews of Babraham Bioinformatics, is a very popular tool used to provide an overview of basic quality control metrics for raw next generation sequencing data. 


There are a number different analyses (called modules) that may be performed on a sequence data set. 

The authors give good examples of why certain metrics may fail
